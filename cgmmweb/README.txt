This is a fork off CGMM v0.7.0 (CSM API 4.2: https://github.com/NCIP/common-security-module/tree/CSM_4_2_RELEASE). It was created in order to address a CTRP issue that occurred after the caGrid team had upgraded the Training Grid Authentication Service to version 2.0. CGMM component is hard-wired into PO/PA JBoss and provides a Catalina Authentication Valve that handles form-based grid authentication in PO/PA. After the Auth Service upgrade, the component stopped working. The CSM team had no immediate plans to address this issue; hence we forked the component's codebase and addressed the issue ourselves. Please check SVN history to see what mods exactly have been done.

CGMM Jar with the modifications has been placed in build-po\common\cgmm\cgmm-libs.zip and build-pa\common\cgmm\cgmm-libs.zip
